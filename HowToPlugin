A guide to mount an (existing) Importer/Exporter(-class) to the plugin-system.

1. Build the wrapper class for the plugin, which extends "Plugin", the constructor uses the wrapper from the superclass.

	public class XYImporter extends Plugin {
		
		public XYImporter(final PluginWrapper wrapper) {
			super(wrapper);
	[...]

	}

2. The actual implementation follows with "@Extension".
   Herefore, there are already some abstract Importer with methods provided which you can extend from 
   or you can write a new abstract class, where you extend the interface, as it is, e.g. AbstractImporter.
   It is important that the interface exists as Extension Point, i.e. extends ExtensionPoint.

	@Extension
	public static class XYImporterImplementation extends ZImporter {
	
	[...]

	}
